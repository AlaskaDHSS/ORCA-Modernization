## We’re glad you’re interested in our project!

We’re developing a new way of working with the vendor community. We want to collaborate with vendors as a cross-functional product team, working on smaller modules, in the open, to iteratively improve the services we provide to Alaska’s children. Our goal is to avoid a stand-alone, multi-year, monolithic contract that would take a long time to compete, and a long time for the vendor team to deliver working functionality to end users.

This approach won’t eliminate all risk, and it will take us time to work through this new approach to procurement. We will be trying a new way to incrementally build software to modernize our our legacy SACWIS system, called ORCA, that improves the experience of users of our systems and helps us better serve the children of Alaska. 

With that said, OCS envisions a transparent procurement process in which smaller vendor teams compete for different modules as we define what’s needed to continue building the product. Some of the work will be done concurrently by different vendors, through different contracts. Some of the work will need to be done sequentially. But all of the work will be done in the open, to ensure a smooth transition of well-documented code among the different vendors that are working to assist Alaska. We are continuing to develop a more [comprehensive product roadmap](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/ORCA-Modernization/projects/1), which will lay out the work ahead of us and help us prioritize the work we do.

## So, what does this mean to the interested vendor community?

We intend this public GitHub repository to be the source of information as we move forward in our planning and implementation of this new approach. We will do our best to keep this repo updated as decisions are made or if we need to pivot in our plans as we learn. We also want to hear from the vendor community if you have any comments or questions - we’ll plan on posting our first draft RFP in Q4 2018 for feedback and questions.

## Who are we looking for?

We are looking for vendors that are excited about working in new ways with government, and that embrace the following approaches:

- User-centered research and design
- Open source, test driven software development using modern approaches
- Agile methods where the State and the vendor work as a team to produce great products
- Delivery over documentation (although we still need the code to be well-documented, you’ll see that in our RFPs)
- OK with smaller dollar contracts - with an understanding that successful delivery will help in future module procurements
- Most important, knowing how to deliver great products over knowing how to sell. We want vendors that put their engineers, designers, and developers first, vs. their business development. Because the procurements will be smaller, we don’t intend to have 125 page RFP’s with 1000 “shall statements” that require enormous proposal efforts. We are going to experiment with ways to make the buying process easier for both Alaska and interested vendors.

## Stay tuned

We expect the first in a series of modular procurements to be issued in Q4 2018, initially in draft form to allow vendors a chance to review and comment, and then in final form before the year’s end.
Keep watching this repo for updates as we move closer to the release of our first draft later this year.
